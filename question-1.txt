declare a array(to store count of string), a vector to store count increasing order. 
[1]. First take the input of T and apply validation.
[2]. Run a loop from T to 1.
[3]. Take the input as string a.
[4]. fill the frequency array with 0;
[5], run a loop for and increase the count of a[i]-'a'(means )  position by 1.
[6]. sort the c array.
[7]. clear the vector f.
[8]. push the count>1 in the f vector.
[9]. if 
     size of f <2 print Dynamic.
    else  
     check condition f[i]=f[i-1]+f[i-2] for position 2 to size of f.

[9.1]     if any of these position condition false print Not.
          else print true.
